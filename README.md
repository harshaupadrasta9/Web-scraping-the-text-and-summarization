# Web Scraping and Summarization Project

This project involves scraping a Wikipedia page and summarizing its content using a text summarization model. Specifically, the page on Alexander the Great is scraped while retaining the original headings and sub-headings, and the T5-base model is used for summarization.

## Steps Involved

### Step 1: Scraping the Wikipedia Page

The first step is to scrape the Wikipedia page [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) using BeautifulSoup. The objective is to retain the original headings and sub-headings to maintain the structure of the content.

### Step 2: Summarizing the Content

The second step involves summarizing the scraped content using the T5-base model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
