            "in 337 BC, Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother . he continued to Illyria where he sought refuge with one or more kings . it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son .\n",

Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus . in the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine .\n",
            "multiple accounts of Alexander's death suggest foul play . the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death . if Alexander was poisoned, the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album) may have been used .\n",
            "natural-cause theories emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds . the anguish that Alexander felt after his death may also have contributed to his declining health .\n",

            "the 2014 discovery of an enormous tomb dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that it was intended to be the burial place of Alexander . the memorial was found to be dedicated to the dearest friend of Alexander, Hephaestion .\n",
            "details on the fate of the tomb in Alexandria are hazy . around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed the tomb to the public . his son and successor, Caracalla, visited the tomb during his own reign .\n",
            "it was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus . it was discovered near Sidon and is now in the Istanbul archaeology museum . the bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting and hunting .\n",

            "when reports of Alexander's death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed . a theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard \"tôi Kraterôi\"\n",
            "arrian and plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this time . Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story . Alexander passed his signet ring to a bodyguard in front of witnesses .\n",
            "perdiccas suggested that Roxane's baby would be king, if male, with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians . the infantry rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion . after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings .\n",
            "after the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed . the Hellenistic world settled into three stable power blocs: Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Syria and East . both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered in the process .\n",

            "### Last plans\n",
            "diodorus: Alexander gave detailed written instructions to Craterus before his death . the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were extravagant . perdiccas had read the notebooks containing Alexander's last plans to troops in Babylon .\n",

            "he never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered . he used terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and fierce loyalty .\n",
            "in his first battle in Asia, Alexander used only a small part of his forces . his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persians' scimitars .\n",
            "Alexander led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army . darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx .\n",
            "when faced with unfamiliar opponents, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style . in india, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants .\n",
            "\n",
            "### Physical appearance\n",
            "historians often give conflicting accounts of Alexander's appearance . ancient authors recorded that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image . artistic portrayals of Alexander \"seek to legitimize him\" despite caveats .\n",
            "historian Curtius Rufus gives his account of Alexander sitting on the throne of Darius III . he writes that he was a christian and a god . Rufus also wrote the Histories of Alexander the Great:\n",
            "one of the royal pages placed a table under Alexander's feet . since his feet did not reach its lowest step, he was placed on the royal throne .\n",
            "when darius III's mother first met him, she assumed he was Alexander . hephaestion was the taller and more handsome of the two .\n",
            "the Greek biographer Plutarch (c. 45 – c. 120 AD) discusses the accuracy of his depictions:\n",
            "aristotle: the outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by statues of him made by Lysippus . in painting him wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy . a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh .\n",
            "Historians have understood the detail of the pleasant fragrance attributed to Alexander as stemming from a belief in ancient Greece that pleasant scents are characteristic of gods and heroes .\n",
            "he has a straight nose, a slightly protruding jaw, full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead . he is also described as having a slight upward tilt of his head to the left.\n",
            "the ancient historian Aelian describes Alexander's hair color as \"\" (xanthn) at the time, hair could mean yellowish, brownish or reddish . it is sometimes claimed that Alexander had one blue and one brown eye .\n",
            "\n",
            "### Personality\n",
            "his father Philip was probably Alexander's most immediate and influential role model . his mother Olympia encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire .\n",
            "according to Plutarch, Alexander had a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature . he was also a calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating . his intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general .\n",
            "erudite and patronized both arts and sciences . he had little interest in sports or the Olympic games . his unique abilities were demonstrated by inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia .\n",
            "his delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world . the meaning of his epithet has descended into a historical cliché .\n",
            "edward mccaffery: Alexander believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself . he says he adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis . this behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, he writes .\n",
            "\n",
            "### Personal relationships\n",
            "he apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon by Roxana and Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine .\n",
            "hephaestion's death may have contributed to his failing health and detached mental state . he also had a close relationship with his friend and bodyguard .\n",
            "\n",
            "### Sexuality\n",
            "king's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times . none of Alexander's contemporaries are known to have explicitly described his relationship with Hephaestion as sexual . some modern historians believe that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood .\n",
            "green: there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much sexual interest in women . he says green calculates that he had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age . green: two of these pregnancies are of dubious legitimacy .\n",
            "according to Diodorus Siculus, Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings . Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her .\n",

            "some roman writers used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values . iracundia (anger) and cupiditas gloriae (over-desire for glory)\n",
            "\"the Caesars\" describes a contest between the previous roman emperors . he calls in Alexander the Great as an extra contestant in the presence of the assembled gods.\n",
            "Julius Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in hispania after his wife's funeral . while there, he encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction he was now at an age when he had the world at his feet .\n",
            "he posed as the \"new Alexander\" since he was his boyhood hero . \"the new Alexander\" is a fictional character based on a true story .\n",
            "the term Phalangarii has two possible meanings, both with military connotations . first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes . the second bears similarity to the 'Marian Mules' of the late Roman Republic .\n",
            "caracalla's mania for Alexander went so far that he persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that aristotle had poisoned Alexander . this mania was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria .\n",
            "in 39, Caligula ordered a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons . the bridge stretched for over two miles from the resort of Baiae to the neighbouring port of Puteoli .\n",
            "the diffusion of Greek culture and language served as a \"precondition\" for the later Roman expansion into these territories, according to errington . he cites a number of factors that contributed to the growth of the Byzantine empire .\n",
            "\n",
            "### Letters\n",
            "a few official letters addressed to the Greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone . fictitious letters, some perhaps based on actual letters, made their way into the romance tradition .\n",
            "\n",
            "### In legend\n",
            "many of the legends about Alexander derby derive from his own lifetime . his court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him . onesicritus invented a tryst between Alexander and Thalestris .\n",
            "a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance . this text underwent over one hundred recensions, translations, and derivations . it contained many dubious stories and was translated into twenty-five languages .\n",
            "\n",
            "### In ancient and modern culture\n",
            "the great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures . the Alexander Romance has had a significant impact on portrayals of the great . he has featured in both high and popular culture .\n",
            "he is the only ancient hero to appear in the Karagiozis shadow play . a solitary mermaid would grasp a ship's prow and ask the captain, \"Is King Alexander alive?\" the answer should be \"He is alive and well and rules the world!\"\n",
            "in pre-Islamic Middle Persian (Zoroastrian) literature, Alexander is referred to by the epithet gujastak . in Islamic Persia, under the influence of the Alexander Romance, a more positive portrayal emerges .\n",
            "the figure of Dhu al-Qarnayn is believed to be a reference to Alexander the Great . he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of Gog and Magog . in this tradition, he also travelled the known world in search of the water of life .\n",
            "he was portrayed as the son of the last pharaoh before the Persian conquest . his defeat of darius was depicted as Egypt's salvation .\n",
            "the Book of Daniel describes a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire . this is cited as a reason for sparing Jerusalem .\n",
            "the name \"Sikandar\", derived from the Persian name for Alexander, denotes a rising young talent . in medieval India, Turkic and Afghan sovereigns from the Iranian-cultured region of Central Asia brought positive cultural connotations of Alexander .\n",
            "in the Greek Anthology, there are poems referring to Alexander . [320][321][220][128]\n",
            "the song 'Alexander the Great' by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden is indicative . some films that have been shot with the theme of Alexander are:\n",
            "there are also many references to other movies and TV series . there are a lot of references to the movies and television series i have seen .\n",
            "the trilogy \"Alexander the Great\" by Valerio Massimo Manfredi . \"the son of the dream\", \"the sand of Amon\" and \"the ends of the world\"\n",
            "Irish playwright Aubrey Thomas de Vere wrote Alexander the Great, a Dramatic Poem . he is the author of a novel, titled \"Alexander the Great,\" which is based on a poem by the same name .\n",
            "\n",
            "### Historiography\n",
            "contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life were all lost . later works based on these original sources have survived . the earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC)\n",
